# Recipe Ideas â€” Taylor

This is a small React + Vite app built for the persona "Taylor" (a busy professional) to find recipe ideas based on an ingredient they have.

Features

- Search recipes by ingredient using TheMealDB public API (no auth required)
- Responsive grid of recipe cards with images and names
- Loading and error handling for no results or network issues

npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```

3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes

- The app uses TheMealDB filter API: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient}
